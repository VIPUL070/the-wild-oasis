# Wild Oasis

A custom-built hotel management application for a boutique luxury cabin resort.

## About

Wild Oasis is a small boutique hotel featuring 8 luxurious wooden cabins. This application serves as the complete management system for handling bookings, cabins, and guests.

## Purpose

The internal application is used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive and manage all hotel operations.

## Current Status

This project is being built from the ground up, including:
- Custom API development
- Internal hotel management system

## Future Plans

A customer-facing website is planned for the future, where guests will be able to book stays using the same API.
